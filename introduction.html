        <h3>Personal background:</h3> I grew up in the midwest (Chicago area)  but I have lived in the Charlotte area since 1980. I have been on several different </br>
          career paths: Construction trades, Engineering, Computer drafting (Civil Engineering, and Architecture), and now GIS (Geographic Information System).  </br>
          The best job I have had was as the CAD/GIS Manager for Charlotte/Douglas International Airport during the 90’s and early 2000’s.  Through some of </br>
          these paths I’ve learned that I really love programming; especially being able to automate some of my workflows.  I have dabbled around with programming </br>
          for decades; just taking a class here and there.  Finally decided it was time to get serious and target a programming degree. I am currently finishing </br>
          the second year of the Full Stack Programming curriculum.

        <h3>Academic background:  </h3>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>BS in Civil Engineering - UNCC  </li>
        <li>AAS in Computer Network Administration - CPCC   </li>
        <li>AAS in Geographic Information System - CPCC   </li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Background in this subject:</h3>I have little experience in web development; basically just WEB 110, and CTI-110 but the JavaScript in CTI-110 was </br>
        something I really enjoyed.  Looking forward to learning more about JavaScript. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Primary Computer Platform: </h3> I’ve been almost strictly a Windows guy but open to learning different OSs.  I’m currently taking CTI-130 OS and Device </br>
        Foundations where I will learn some about other systems.  Looking forward to it.

        <h3>Courses I've Taken & Why </h3>(all required for Full Stack except ARC-225):
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          DBA-120 Database Programming
        </li>
        <li>
            CIS-115 Introduction to Progamming and Logic as well as CSC-121 Python Programming (both courses are really basically Python 1 and 2).  </br>
            Love Python!!! Such a simple yet powerful programming language.  My GIS software interfaces directly with Python so I am definitely  </br>
            looking forward to some enhanced workflows.
        </li>
        <li>
          ARC225 - Building Information Model (BIM) - a fun class that allowed me to relive the days when I did architectural drawings. </br>
          Only this software is so much, much more powerful.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Courses I am currently enrolled in (required for Full Stack):</h3>

        <h3>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I love the outdoors and particularly kayaking and camping.  
          </li>
          <li>
            While working at the airport I got the bug and just had to learn to fly.  I got my private pilot’s license and flew for several years.  </br>
            Could not keep it up due to the cost but had a lot of fun and some interesting and some unforgettable experiences.  </br>
            Nothing like seeing the countryside from 10,000 ft. 
          </li>
          <li>
            BTW, the picture does not do me justice: I’m really not that handsome.
